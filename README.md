MOVING BALL PROJECT
Welcome to the Moving Ball project! This simple yet engaging project was created using Processing 4 and showcases the animation of a ball moving back and forth along a horizontal line on the screen. The ball exhibits smooth and consistent motion, making it a visually appealing demonstration.
FEATURES
The ball moves horizontally across the screen constantly, creating a fluid animation.
Interactivity is introduced by allowing the user to freeze the ball's motion using the mouse button.
When the mouse button is pressed, the ball freezes in its current position.
Releasing the mouse button resumes the ball's motion from where it was paused.
PREVIEW
Check out the video to see the running ball animation in action.
